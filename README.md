# Fife-DSP

A functional, data driven DSP engine meant to be implemented on embedded systems for audio effect units.

Some goals of this engine include:

  - Understandable code style with conceptual comments and technique explainations 
  - Good Documentation with Implementation Examples
  - Customizable engine for different audio applications
  - Easy to write new DSP functions without needing to change implementation
